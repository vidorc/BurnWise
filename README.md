BurnWise: Calories Burnt Prediction
üìñ Overview
BurnWise is a Python-based machine learning project that predicts the number of calories a person burns during physical activity. By analyzing various physiological and exercise-related features, it provides an estimated calorie expenditure, helping users track their fitness goals more effectively.

This model is built using a Random Forest Regressor and trained on a dataset containing user attributes and workout data.

‚ú® Features
Calorie Prediction: Estimates calories burned based on user inputs.

User Attributes: Considers age, gender, height, and weight for personalized predictions.

Workout Data: Uses exercise duration, heart rate, and body temperature to improve accuracy.

Easy to Use: Simple command-line interface to get predictions.

Extensible: The model can be retrained with new data to improve over time.

üíª Technologies Used
Python

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning model.

Matplotlib / Seaborn: For data visualization (optional).

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need to install the required libraries.

pip install pandas scikit-learn

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/BurnWise.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd BurnWise

Usage
To predict calories burnt, run the predict.py script with the required user and workout information.

(You will need to create the predict.py script where you load your trained model and use it for predictions)

Example command:

python predict.py --gender 'male' --age 25 --height 175 --weight 70 --duration 30 --heart_rate 120 --body_temp 37.5

üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How It Works
The model was trained on a dataset of individuals with the following features:

Gender

Age

Height

Weight

Duration of exercise (in minutes)

Heart Rate (beats per minute)

Body Temperature (in Celsius)

The target variable is the number of Calories Burnt. A Random Forest Regressor was chosen for its high accuracy and robustness in handling non-linear data.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
The predictions made by this model are estimates and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice. The accuracy of the prediction depends on the quality of the input data and the scope of the dataset used for training.
